AI Podcast Suite ‚Äì Google TTS Credentials Setup (Shiper)
=========================================================

1Ô∏è‚É£ FILES INCLUDED
- services/tts/loadGoogleCreds.js
- services/tts/index.js (already patched)
- GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON.txt (minified JSON for Shiper variable)
- This README-TTS-GOOGLE.txt

2Ô∏è‚É£ WHAT THIS DOES
The new helper automatically writes your Google service account JSON from
the environment variable into a temporary file inside the container:
    /tmp/google_creds.json

This file path is exported to GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS so that
Google Text-to-Speech authenticates normally.

3Ô∏è‚É£ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES TO SET IN SHIPER
In your Shiper dashboard ‚Üí Variables:

   NODE_ENV = production
   PORT = 8080
   GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON = <paste contents of GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON.txt>

4Ô∏è‚É£ HOW TO GET THE ONE-LINE JSON
If you ever regenerate credentials:
   cat turingpodcasttts-e58851648e74.json | jq -c > GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON.txt

5Ô∏è‚É£ REDEPLOY
After saving the variables, redeploy your app on Shiper.

On startup you should see:
   ‚úÖ Google credentials written to /tmp/google_creds.json
   üîä Google TTS client initialized successfully
   üöÄ AI Podcast Suite Unified Server Started
