Modified/Added (drop into project root):

- services/env-checker.js (global, hard-stop env validator)
- services/r2-client.js (master shared R2 client; no ping/retry; HeadBucket validation)
- services/s3client.js (alias for legacy imports)
- README-R2-MERGE.md (how to wire into each service)
- package.json.add-these-versions.json (dependency hint)

Next steps:
1) Delete all per-service r2/s3 clients and any 'ping/attempt' retry blocks.
2) Update imports in all services to point at '../services/r2-client.js' and '../services/env-checker.js'.
3) Ensure '@aws-sdk/client-s3' matches the recommended version in package.json.
4) Clear Shiper build cache and redeploy.
