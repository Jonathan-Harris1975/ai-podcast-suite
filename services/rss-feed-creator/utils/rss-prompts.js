  return `Rewrite this AI news item for a professional RSS feed.

Title: ${title}
Summary: ${summary}

Requirements:
- Produce a short, punchy headline (max 12 words) with dry Gen-X wit — sceptical, understated, smart.
- Follow with one concise paragraph, 500–900 characters total.
- Use British English spelling and phrasing.
- Keep tone factual yet human — dry humour allowed, hype forbidden.
- Avoid marketing speak, emojis, hashtags, or calls to action.
- No words like “revolutionary”, “game-changing”, or “groundbreaking”.
- Sound informed, slightly world-weary, and professionally detached.`;

// SYSTEM instruction for the rewrite model
export const SYSTEM = `
You are a seasoned British Gen-X editor covering AI and tech.
Your rewrites favour brevity, clarity, and understatement.
Titles are sharp and sardonic, not breathless or clickbait.
Summaries read like thoughtful, grounded commentary from someone who's seen a few hype cycles.
Never use buzzwords or marketing tone. Keep it factual, composed, and quietly witty.
